Installation for Linux

Only the libc and openssl packages must be installed to compile the client library.
For Debian-based distributions, execute:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:
sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel

Installation of these packages will also install gcc. gcc -version must show a version of 4.1 or better. 
g++ is also supported, with the same version restriction.

Download the Citrusleaf C client tarball and decompress it. 
tar -xzf citrusleaf_client_c-2.0.23.tgz

There are two ways to use the library: statically link the provided source code into your 
application, or dynamically link against the library. Statically linking prevents you 
from having to install the libraries on your target platform; dynamically linking avoids a client
rebuild if you upgrade the client.  Choose the option that is right for you.

In the example subdirectory, you'll find an example 
makefile and short C program that links against the provided libraries. The provided makefile
links against local libraries.

The root level 'Makefile' automatically executed make -f src/Makefile.native , which uses
that GCC -march=native as a compilation target. Other examples, such as src/Makefile.32 and src/Makefile.64,
build explicitly for 32 and 64 bit environments.
