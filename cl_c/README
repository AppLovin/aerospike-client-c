Installation for Linux

libc and openssl packages must be installed to compile the client library.

For Debian-based distributions, execute:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:

    sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel

Installation of these packages will also install gcc. 
gcc -version must show a version of 4.1 or better. 
g++ is also supported with the same version restriction.

Download the C client tarball and decompress it. 

    tar -xzf citrusleaf_client_c-2.0.23.tgz

There are two ways to use the library: static link the provided source code into
your application, or dynamic link against the library. Static linking prevents 
you from having to install the libraries on your target platform. Dynamic 
linking avoids a client rebuild if you upgrade the client.  Choose the option
that is right for you.

In the example subdirectory, you'll find an example makefile and short C program
that links against the provided libraries.

The root level Makefile automatically executes "make -f src/Makefile.native", 
which uses the GCC "-march=native" as a compilation target. Other examples, 
such as src/Makefile.32 and src/Makefile.64, build explicitly for 32 and 64 
bit environments.

If the resulting executable will be run on multiple cpu platforms, "-march=native" 
should be replaced with "-march=nocona". This turns off cpu specific optimizations.
