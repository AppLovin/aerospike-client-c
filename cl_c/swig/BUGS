1. Bin array while getting bins:
   Don't just put value into bins, but make its type = NULL also.
   Mention the same in documentation that if SWIG is getting used using C as base, make sure to take care in the target language.

2. Memory leak while calling citrusleaf_get_all in target language.
   create pointer to cl_bin* which allocates memory of 1 cl_bin*
   In function citrusleaf_get_all value of cl_bin** is getting changed. Hence in target language we have no reference to allocated cl_bin*, which leads to memory leakage.

3. Assiging values to array elements.
   While creating array, memory of size*sizeof(structure) got allocated.
   For every index of array new element to structure is allocated and reference is assigned to corresponding index of array.
   This leads to duplicate memory allocation.
   ex: test.py:203-211
   Similarly check for other arrays too.
   This bug is only in python test example.
