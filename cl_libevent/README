Installation for Linux

Only the libc, openssl, and libevent packages must be installed to compile the client library.

For Debian based distributions, like Ubuntu, the following packages must be installed: 

    sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:

    sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel

Installation of these packages will also install gcc. gcc -version must show a version of 4.1 or better. 
g++ is also supported, with the same version restriction.

Download the Citrusleaf C client tarball and decompress it. 
    tar xzf citrusleaf_client_libevent-2.0.x.tgz

For the examples to work properly, you may need to download libevent 1.4 
from http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/.
Decompress the tarball to a directory at the same level as citrusleaf_client_libevent. 

In the example subdirectory, you'll find an example makefile and short C program that shows how 
to write a short program to link against the provided evcitrusleaf, and the main-line libevent 
distribution. The provided makefile simply links against local libraries. Alternately, 
the provided evcitrusleaf code can be compiled directly into the libevent library similar to evdns 
and evhttp. If this type of installation is desired, you will need to manually move the provided 
Citrusleaf files into a libevent source directory and update the libevent Makefile.in, as you would
a patch. 
Choosing the appropriate linkage and distribution option for your application and environment 
is beyond the scope of this document.
