Linux Installation:

Only the libc and openssl packages must be installed to compile the client library.
For Debian-based distributions, execute:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:
sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel


Libevent2 has a number of differences with Libevent, has
clashes with header files. On a machine which has both old libevent and the new 
libevent2, there can be subtle run-time failures.

In order to allow the old libevent to co-exist with libevent2, this is the process we have followed:
-- download libevent2 from libevent.org.
-- configure the build to be installed in /usr/local.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local ; make ; sudo make install
-- the Makefiles in this package will explicitly link to /usr/local/lib/libevent-2.0.so.5 

The root level 'Makefile' automatically executed make -f src/Makefile.native , which uses
that GCC -march=native as a compilation target. Other examples, such as src/Makefile.32 and src/Makefile.64,
build explicitly for 32 and 64 bit environments.

If the resulting executable will be run on multiple cpu platforms, "-march=native" should be
replaced with "-march=nocona". This turns off cpu specific optimizations.
