Libevent2 has a number of differences with Libevent, has
clashes with header files. On a machine which has both old libevent and the new 
libevent2, there can be subtle run-time failures.

In order to allow the old libevent to co-exist with libevent2, this is the process we have followed:
-- download libevent2 from libevent.org.
-- configure the build to be installed in /usr/local.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local ; make ; sudo make install
-- the Makefiles in this package will explicitly link to /usr/local/lib/libevent-2.0.so.5
