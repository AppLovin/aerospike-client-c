Linux Installation:

Only the libc and openssl packages must be installed to compile the client library.
For Debian-based distributions, execute:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev libssl-dev

For redhat derived distributions such as Fedora Core and Centos, excute:
sudo yum install openssl-devel glibc-devel

Some newer Linux systems (Ubuntu 12.04) come with libevent2 already installed. 
The dev version is still required:
		$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

On older systems, libevent2 must be installed manually, following these steps:

1. Remove the old libevent. The libevent2 library will be backward compatible,
   so software relying on the old libevent will still work with libevent2.
		$ sudo yum remove libevent

2. Download the latest libevent2 from libevent.org, e.g.
   libevent-2.0.20-stable.tar.gz.

3. Extract, and go to the resulting directory, e.g.
		$ tar -xzvf libevent-2.0.20-stable.tar.gz
		$ cd libevent-2.0.20-stable

4. Configure libevent2 to be installed in /usr/lib and install it. (Amazingly,
   we have found the default configuration may install in /usr/local/lib.)
		$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
		$ make
		$ sudo make install

5. Make sure the new library is recognized.
		$ sudo /sbin/ldconfig


The root level 'Makefile' automatically executed make -f src/Makefile.native , which uses
that GCC -march=noarch as a compilation target. Other examples, such as src/Makefile.32 and 
src/Makefile.64, build explicitly for 32 and 64 bit environments.
